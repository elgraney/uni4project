There are multiple avenues to pursue.
1. Clustering on optical flow --> leads to improved features?
2. Filter items with camera motion out of data set
3. Buy set up and implement weather station and learning system. Relies heavily on Sam.
4. Fully explore parameters, features, machine learning and optical flow methods to draw conclusions.

Note:
Wind footage 1 = same as last year
Wind footage 2 = added extra items
Wind footage 3 = added extra items, removed innapropriate items
