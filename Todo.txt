There are multiple avenues to pursue.
1. Clustering on optical flow --> leads to improved features? 
2. Filter items with camera motion out of data set  _/
3. Buy set up and implement weather station and learning system. Relies heavily on Sam. _/
4. Fully explore parameters, features, machine learning and optical flow methods to draw conclusions. 
    4.1 mlp
    4.2 decision tree 
5. Normalise opflow and see how it goes.

Note:
Wind footage 1 = same as last year
Wind footage 2 = added extra items
Wind footage 3 = added extra items, removed innapropriate items
